      "Kolohe Andino is currently Lowers’ alpha male. Ruling by respect, not fear, Brother struts through his kingdom with long, confident strides, often scratching into waves that others would need a motor, a paddle, or a push from daddy to catch. Then he surfs them with a Navy Seal’s precision and tap dancer’s grace.",

    hometown: "San Clemente, CA, USA",
    bio:
      "The next in line for Lowers supremacy is Griffin Colapinto, whose very existence threatens Kolohe’s reign. More of a “feel” surfer than Brother, Griffin’s languid approach is easy on the eyes and warming to the heart. But don’t let his leisurely gait fool you--Griff’s as competitive as they come and would love nothing more than to knock Kolohe from his royal perch. ",

    bio:
      "The jester. The outcast. The horse whose hue skews dark. As a goofy-footer and non-CT surfer, Ian Crane is the least likely Surf100 winner...on paper. The funny thing about paper, though, is that it tends to fall apart in water. And for our money, Crane-o’s got the most creative bag of the bunch, which might just be the difference-maker at this cookie-cutter point.",
