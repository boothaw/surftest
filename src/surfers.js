    bio:
      "Jack Robinson is a top-5 barrel-rider in the world, and the best to ever do it at North Point. His read of the ocean is entirely preternatural—he sees things other surfers do not, and has a technique that borders on perfection. Despite being just 22, he is the odds-on favorite to win this event.",

    bio:
      "The next in line for North Point supremacy is the silverback himself, Jay Davies. A little older and a little wiser, Jay will likely wait for the biggest, meanest double-ups of the day to begin his rampage against the youths. Having recently been subjected to laboring on a tugboat, Jay’s got a surf career to revive.",

    bio:
      "Being the sole goofyfoot in the draw, Jacob will be at a distinct disadvantage at North Point. That’s not how he sees it though. In Jacob’s eyes, his ability to stall and maximize tube time will clip the naturals at their knees and prove once and for all that screwfoots can go both ways.",

    bio:
      "Kael Walsh is the undisputed darkhorse of this Surf100. With a blatant disregard for reef impact, he’s one you might expect to take off well under the lip or huck himself off a heaving closeout section. If he falls, he falls. If he doesn’t, watch out. ",
